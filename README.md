# Some-Maths-Supplements

This repository lists short notes I have written up for courses offered at Gatsby Unit, UCL, either to provide missing proofs and results or to reconcile them with what I have learned from Cambridge Mathematics. Suggestions and corrections welcome at kevin.huang.han.work[at]gmail.com.

## To-do
- Proof for Jensen's in Banach space (and more abstract spaces?)
- Rescue the lost draft for convergence...
